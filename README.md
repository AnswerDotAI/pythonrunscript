# ./pythonrunscript

`pythonrunscript` lets you

- define and run **single-file python scripts**
- which **automatically install needed dependencies into isolated environments**
- while **using normal external dependencies** from pip or conda

## How to use pythonrunscript

pythonrunscript lets you declare your scriptâ€™s dependencies in the script itself.

This is in order to let you build and use scripts that *just run*, with no environment setup.

To declare your scriptâ€™s pip dependencies, add a *pip requirements block*. This is a block of comments which embeds a pip requirements.txt file into your script, using Python's official PEP723 syntax for [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata). For example, the script below includes a pip requirement block which defines a one-line requirements.txt file, declaring a dependency on version 4.66.4 of the pip package `tqdm`.

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env pythonrunscript
#
# /// pythonrunscript-requirements-txt
# tqdm==4.66.4
# ///
#
from tqdm import tqdm
import sys

print("Hello, I depend on the tqdm package!")
for i in tqdm(range(10000)):
    pass
print("Phew. That was fun!")
```

The first time you run this script, pythonrunscript will extract the embedded requirements.txt file, create an isolated environment, install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt, and run the script from that environment. In later runs, it will just re-use that environment. To create the environment it uses venv, which is built into python, so the only requirement to use pythonrunscript is that python itself is already installed.

To run your script, call it with `pythonrunscript hello.py`. Alternatively, in order to execute your script directly with `./hello.py`, change your scriptâ€™s first line (the "shebang" line) to the following: `#!/usr/bin/env pythonrunscript`. In both cases, if you later remove the inline metadata comment block, pythonrunscript will run the script normally since it just passes the script to `python3`. In other words, pythonrunscript does not depend on finding metadata.

Conversely, if you use the normal interpreter to call a script with inline metadata, by doing `python3 hello.py`, then python3 will ignore the special metadata comments just like other comments, and run the script as usual.

The upshot is, you can use pythonrunscript to run a normal python script, but if you add pythonrunscript metadata to a script, it can still be run normally by someone who has never heard of pythonrunscript.

## Installation and Requirements

Here are two ways to install pythonrunscript:

1.  Do `python3 -m pip install pythonrunscript`, which will install `pythonrunscript` into your PATH.
2.  Or, manually copy the file `pythonrunscript` from the `bin/` directory of this repo into a directory named in your `PATH` variable.

`pythonrunscript` runs on Linux and macOS, and needs Python 3.9.6 or higher (which means it can run using the system Python built into macOS Sonoma). It requires conda only if you want to run scripts which themselves require conda.

## How can I check what it will do? If it worked? What happened exactly?

Run pythonrunscript in `--dry-run` mode to get a preview of how it parses your file and the actions it *would* take.

Run with `--verbose` to hear copious commentary, and to see all output of subprocess commands. Normally, pythonrunscript only prints logging in case of an installation error. It always saves all generated output in a logs directory, as well as saving an `environment-resolved.yml` and a `pip-list.txt` which reflect the exact state of the environment after creation. These files are saved in the scriptâ€™s project directory, in the cache, which is revealed by running with the `--show-cache` command. Running with `--clean-cache` moves all cached directories to the OSâ€™s temporary directory for automatic disposal.

## What, why would I want this?

(For a longer explanation, check out [dev chat with me (Alexis), Jeremy Howard, and Johno Whitaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8).)

If none of the above appeals to you, perhaps you never had problems with python dependency management before? (Congrats!) But if the dilemma is totally alien to you and youâ€™re curious, here is the issue.

Suppose youâ€™re writing a single-file Python module, i.e., a script, `hello.py`, like this:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print("Hello, world")
```

Running it is easy. You can run the script by running `./hello.py` and it will just work. Hurray!

But then you need some functionality outside of the standard library, like yaml-parsing from an external dependency like PyYAML. So now you need to install that dependency. This is where pain starts.

Where do you install it? In your systemâ€™s python? Should you use sudo? Or in a managed environment? Managed how? With venv? With virtualenv? With conda? With nix, docker, something else? So should you install that manager first? Where? Do you need requirements.txt? Pipenv? Poetry? pyproject.toml? Something else? These questions all have answers but they are *boring and painful*. Once you distribute your script to someone else, the pain falls on them too. Can you just give them the file? No, since now you need to give them your script and also, perhaps, a mini-essay on how to answer those questions. If you are lucky enough (?) to be a seasoned expert in python dependency management and to associate only with other such experts, then you may not see the problem here. But it is real outside such orbits.

(soapbox modeâ€¦)

There is a reason that the Go and rust communities excel at shipping so many charming and effective command line applications. Why? Because their language toolchains have good support for shipping a static linked executable â€“ that is to say, a single damn file which Just Works. Python would be truly great for scripting, except for the fact that it lacks this power, which makes it impractical to give your script to someone else who just wants to solve their problem with the minimum possible fuss. Sad.

Hopefully, this tool helps. The dependency syntaxes which it uses are exactly the syntaxes already supported by pip and conda. There is nothing exotic here. So you can do everything you can normally do with pip, such as specify dependencies not only as public PyPI packages but also as [URLs to GitHub repos](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/). And you can do everything you can normally do with conda, such as specify the version of Python itself, or install vast wads of awkward binary code from dedicated channels like nvidiaâ€™s.

(soapbox offâ€¦)

## Wait, but I *enjoy* manually keeping environments nice and tidy, even for tiny little scripts!

Great, then, this is not for you. ðŸ˜‡ Cultivate your garden.

## What about conda dependencies?

Some popular dependencies, like [cudatoolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), cannot be installed by pip but need conda.

To specify conda dependencies, you must add a *conda environment.yml block* or a *conda_install_specs_.txt block*. You may use this instead of, or in addition to, a pip requirements.txt block. They use two other types of inline metadata. The environment block is intoduced by ```` /// pythonrunscript-environment-yml ```` and it should contain an environment.yml file verbatim.

The install spec block is introduced by ```` /// pythonrunscript-conda-install-specs-txt ```` block, and it should introduce conda install specs. A conda install spec is simply the string passed to the `conda install` command. Conda documents the [exact syntax for a conda install spec](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/pkg-search.html), which only requires naming the conda package, but also allows specifying the version, the channel, or specific builds.

For instance, this script uses a conda environment.yml block:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env pythonrunscript
#
# /// pythonrunscript-environment-yml
# dependencies:
#   - python=3.10
#   - numpy
# ///
#
import numpy
import sys

print("I depend on numpy")
```

And this script uses a conda install specs block, for the same dependencies:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env pythonrunscript
#
# /// pythonrunscript-conda-install-specs-txt
# python=3.10
# numpy
# ///
#
from tqdm import tqdm
import sys

print("Hello, I depend on the tqdm package!")
for i in tqdm(range(10000)):
    pass
print("Phew. That was fun!")
```

Do you really need conda? Maybe not! If you donâ€™t specify conda dependencies, pythonrunscript wonâ€™t use conda.

But you might need conda if you want to use conda-only dependencies, to specify the version of python itself, or to use packages outside of the Python ecosystem. This [weights & biases blog post](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/pytorch-image-models/reports/A-faster-way-to-get-working-and-up-to-date-conda-environments-using-fastchan---Vmlldzo2ODIzNzA) explains the situation well, and [this script will install conda](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup/blob/master/setup-conda.sh) on all the platforms.)

## So what is PEP-723?

Here is the situation.

[PEP-723](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) defines the official syntax for embedding any kind of metadata in a Python script. It also shows _one_ particular implementation of that standard, with the "script" type of metadata. This is a metadata block introduced by the opening delimiter ```` /// script ````. Here's an example of a script with such a block:

``` python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "numpy",
# ]
# ///
#
import numpy
import sys

print("I depend on numpy")
```

As you can see, the "script" metadata type requires a TOML-like syntax, and it lets you declare pip dependencies (like `numpy`) as well as a required version of python (like `3.11`). When a Python script has this "script" type metadata, a compliant tool can use it to run the Python script as a single-file script, by reading the metadata, fetching the dependencies, and running the script in an isolated environment containing those dependencies.

`pythonrunscript` does this. It recognizes the "script" metadata type. If the "script" metadata only declares pip dependencies, pythonrunscript just uses pip to install them. If it also declares a required python version, then pythonrunscript uses conda to manage the python version itself.

But in addition to the "script" type metadata, PEP-723 also specifies how tools can define _other_ metadata types. pythonrunscript also defines the following types:

- `pythonrunscript-requirements-txt`, which lets you embed a standard `requirements.txt` file.
- `pythonrunscript-conda-install-specs-txt`, which lets you embed a list of normal conda install specs.
- `pythonrunscript-environment-yml`, which lets you embed a normal `environment.yml` file.

In other words, pythonrunscript implements the PEP723 syntax for embedding inline metadata, implements the recommended "script" metadata type, and also implements PEP723's mechanism for defining particular types of inline metadata. It defines three types which represent embedding the popular dependency file types which you might be using already.

(In addition, pythonrunscript also supports a legacy syntax for embedding metadata in terms of  markdown-style code fences. I designed it to use this syntax before I realized that PEP723 existed! It is now deprecated.)

## Comparable solutions

What else is out there, to solve this problem of "I just want a single-file I can deploy easily?"

### `uv`

Another tool which supports PEP732 is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies). It is is excellent and I would recommend it. But it only implements the "script" metadata type.

Compared to pythonrunscript, I'd say that `uv` is better choice if:

- You don't mind rewriting your dependencies as TOML fragments.
- You don't need conda-only dependencies.
- You value `uv`'s superior speed.

On the other hand, pythonrunscript might be a better choice if:

- You want to describe your dependencies using formats you already use, like requirements.txt, conda install specs, or environment.yml files.
- You need certain dependencies available only on conda, such as executables like `ffmpeg` for video transcoding, `poppler` for processing PDFs, or various heavier ML components.
- You prefer a tool which requires only python, and which is small enough to understand and hack on. (pythonrunscript itself is less than 600 lines of Python.)

###  pip.wtf

I haven't tried this but it seems like an inspired solution if you want your scripts to have zero install-time dependencies, not even pythonrunscript itself.

It's just eight lines of code which defines a function which you then add directly to your script. In your script, calling this function will install the script's dependencies and run it using them. Beautiful.

However, it might not be approriate when you want your script to run like a normal script by default, e.g., not to install dependencies when you just run it with the normal interpreter, or when you need conda because your project depends on conda-only dependencies.
